# End-to-End Data Cleaning & Decision Tree Modeling in Python

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end analytics workflow using Python.  
It walks through dataset ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and interpretable machine learning using a Decision Tree Classifier.

The project showcases strong data understanding, feature engineering, and model evaluation—skills relevant for **FinTech**, **Risk Analytics**, **Business Intelligence**, and **Data Science** roles.

## Datasets Used
- **Chickwts.csv** — Weight of chicks fed different protein sources (exploratory analysis)
- **HMEQ dataset (hmeq-1.csv)** — Home Equity Loan credit risk dataset (prediction modeling)
- **OVC Clinical Info** — Clinical dataset used for data cleaning, recoding, and preprocessing practice

---

## Key Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps
- Handling missing values  
- Cleaning inconsistent entries  
- Recoding categorical values  
- Creating dummy variables (one-hot encoding)  
- Detecting and removing outliers with IQR  
- Ensuring datasets are modeling-ready  

---

## Decision Tree Modeling
The HMEQ dataset is used to build a Decision Tree model for predicting credit risk approval.

Includes:
- Train-test split
- Baseline model
- Hyperparameter tuning (max depth, min samples)
- Feature importance analysis
- Visualization of the decision tree
- Classification metrics (accuracy, recall, precision)

## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Google Colab**
